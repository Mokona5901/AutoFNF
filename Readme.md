 This bot is different of [FNFBot](https://github.com/KadeDev/FNFBot) because the concept of this bot is when it notices an arrow or more, it clicks on it<br><br>
It's like an auto-clicker<br><br>
This bot doesn't use the JSON files<br><br>
Even if the arrows move, the bot is able to hit them at the right time<br><br>
