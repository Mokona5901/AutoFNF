This bot is different of FNFBot because the concept of this bot is when it notices an arrow or more, it clicks on it<br><br>
It's like an auto-clicker<br><br>
This bot doesn't use the JSON files like FNFBot<br><br>
Created in Python<br><br>
Even if the arrows move, the bot is able to hit them at the right time<br><br>
Created by Mokona5901<br><br>
The bot creates a kind of line that connects each arrow and picks up when an arrow crosses the line<br><br>
